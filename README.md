# boundingBoxLmao
p5.js powered image annotation tool? idk I'm sleepy
[Bounding Box Demo - press play](https://editor.p5js.org/hamza.ryzvy/sketches/sGSK2Bgly)

this graphics stuff took a while hahaha anyway its pretty late rn I'll add a way to store the coordinates of each bouding box into a json object
and also actually be able to add images to the html probably done through some api endpoint idk (lets see)  and then I'll also have to add
a flask end point that has stored images that can then use  cv2 and numpy to crop images and send the image to front end to show what was actually selecterd
idk if i want to implement that last feature I dont really have a tutorial to follow as I literally coding everything from scratch so yeah anyway  I cant think 
anymore goodnight.


(also I have to figure out a way to adjust the canvas's size to the size of the image and set background to the image itself
so that the bounding box coordinates actually make sense for annotation)
